        <p>Hi! I'm a passionate food lover and love to cook mouth-watering dishes. I was born and grew up in Nigeria where I had the priviledge of eating some of the world's most tasty food. Due to my African descent I have grown to love spicy and hot
          food and have developed a keen interest in trying out the local food of every culture. My goal is to compare and contrast the differences of taste, preparation, ingredients and style of cooking in as many countries as possible and integrate them
          into my own cooking. I hope with this blog you will get to know and possibly be interested in trying out some Nigerian food as they are among the best on the planet. I would love to hear from you and know what experiences are if or after you
          have tried any of the following dishes posted on this blog. </p>
