          <p>Topping the list of my favorite Nigerian food is this traditional delicacy originating from the south-east part of Nigeria called 'Nkwobi'.
            It is a very delicious and spicy eat out meal common in Nigerian restaurants and beer joints which can also be easily prepared at home with simple ingrdients.
            It is prepared with cooked de-hoofed cow foot (popularly known as 'cow leg')in spicy palm oil sauce and a mix of vegetables for garnishing which are lots of onions and Utazi leaves or spinach.
            It usually takes a total time of about an hour and ten minutes to prepare and is best served with a cold glass of beer.
            As i've lived and grown up in Nigeria Nkwobi has been a meal that i find very hard to resist and love having it while hanging out with friends or by myself in a local bar/restaurant. If you are visiting Nigeria i would highly recommend
            you try out this meal and experience it's unique mouth-watering taste.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/zX3Ed_4JzGw" target="_blank"><em><strong>Watch how it's prepared</strong></em></a>

          <p>Bole and Fish is said to have originated in Port Harcourt, the capital city of Rivers State, Nigeria. This city is known for a lot of great things but the most outstanding feature of this great oil city is its local dishes, more
            especially its popular street food called Bole (roasted plantain). Port Harcourt bole and fish is a cuisine of roasted plantain and smoked/grilled fish (the plantain could be ripe, half-ripe or unripe). It's a dish that could served with
            different accompaniment of choice usually a specially prepared stew and any protein of one’s choice (commonly fish or chicken). Bole is a hybrid of the western name Boli, which means roasted plantain. Bole is one of the Nigerian foods you
            should know and love – it has grown to become a popular Nigerian street food enjoyed by all at different levels of the society.

            Bole has become a widespread street food in other parts of the country but Port Harcourt Bole continues to take the lead.

            In the Western part of the country, this delicious chow is served with nicely fried groundnut but the Port Harcourt Bole is served with a specially prepared sauce, made of pepper, salt, onions, oil and seasonings. Another special thing
            about Port Harcourt Bole is the protein it is usually served with, it could be accompanied with finely seasoned roasted fish or chicken. I especially love to have my Bole with the head of fish, double dose of delicious combo!.<br><br> <a

          <p>Jollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. There are several regional variations in name and ingredients. In Mali it is called zaamè in Bamanankan. The dish's most common name of Jollof derives from the name of the
            Wolof people, though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu jën or benachin. In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. Despite the variations, the dish is "mutually intelligible" across the regionas had
            become the best known African dish outside the continent.

            Based on its name, the origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Jolof Empire. Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the
            upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in "linguistic, historical or political patterns". Instead he proposes that the dish spread
            with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of "blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy" as well as the religion
            of Islam. Marc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil
            industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia. It may then have spread throughout the region through the
            historical commercial, cultural and religious channels linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue to thrive today, such as the Tijāniyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal
            annually.<br>Although considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are
            cooked in one pot, of which a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base. Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi
            moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc.

            In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice and there are variations of the classic jollof rice; including coconut jollof rice,
            fisherman jollof rice (made with prawns, periwinkles, crayfish), mixed vegetables jollof rice, and rice and beans. More economical versions of jollof rice are popularly referred to among Nigerians as “concoction rice,” the preparation of
            which can involve as little as rice and pepper <br><br> <a href="https://youtu.be/E0o65LkxJV8" target="_blank"><em><strong>Watch how it's prepared</strong></em></a>

          <p>Egusi soup is a kind of soup thickened with the ground seeds of melon and popular in West Africa, with considerable local variation. Besides the seeds, water, and oil, Egusi soup typically contains leaf vegetables, Palm oil, other
            vegetables, seasonings, and meat. Leaf vegetables typically used for Egusi soup include bitterleaf, pumpkin leaf, celosia and spinach. Typical other vegetables include tomatoes and okra. Typical seasonings include chili peppers, onions,
            and locust beans. Also commonly used are beef, goat, fish, shrimps, or crayfish.
            Egusi soup does not just benefit your stomach, it is a healthy meal rich in iron, calcium, Vitamin A and C, sodium, potassium, protein and carbohydrate and low in fat, cholesterol, fiber, saturated fat, and sugar.


            In Nigeria, Egusi is common among the Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria, the Ibibio people and the Efik people (Calabar people) of southern Nigeria, the Hausa of northern Nigeria and the Edo people, Esan people, and Etsako people of the
            south-west of Nigeria. Yoruba people in general and quite notably the people of Osun State – especially the Ijesha people – eat "iyan and egusi", a pounded yam and egusi soup.

            In Ghana, Egusi is also called akatoa of agushi, and as in Nigeria is used for soup and stew, and most popularly in palaver sauce.

          <p>Goat meat pepper soup, also referred to as nwo-nwo, ngwo-ngwo, and goat pepper soup, is a soup in Nigeria. Goat meat is used as a primary ingredient, and some versions may use crayfish. For variations boiled yams, potatoes, or plantains
            may be added. Versions of the soup may be spicy and hot. The soup is always served hot and is made with a blend of different spices which gives an intense spiciness and flavor to the soup. The dish has been described as being the most
            popular out of all the Nigerian pepper soups. It is a light soup that is often prepared without the use of oil, and may also be drunk in the style of a beverage. It is sometimes accompanied with eba, rice or pounded yam. It has been
            described as pairing well with palm wine and beer.

            Goat meat pepper soup is eaten year round in Nigeria, during hot or cold seasons. It is claimed to help ease a flu or cold if it is cooked the proper way. If assorted parts of the goat are used, certain pieces may need to be cooked longer
            than others.

            There are different varieties of pepper soup which vary according to region, with different combinations of spices. For instance, the Igbo people, in the east, and Riverians in the southeast, prepare their pepper soup with tomatoes,
            onions and spices. Those of Delta origin sometimes prepare the pepper soup with ataiko, uda, gbafilo, rigije, and lemon grass leaves. In Yoruba, goat meat pepper soup is sometimes referred to as Oggun. <br>There are many different
            ingredients used depending on the region and availability. Common ingredients in goat meat pepper soup are goat meat,crayfish, Uziza, Negro Pepper (also called Uda Ewentia or Enge) and nutmeg, such as Calabash Nutmeg (also called Ehu or
            Ariwo). Other ingredients that are commonly used when access to traditional ingredients is limited are bouillon cubes, onion,salt, pepper, basil and chili pepper. Some versions also use a goat's head. Preparation involves cleaning and
            seasoning the meat and simmering with chopped onions, after which water is added and the dish is further cooked. The dish may be finished with seasoning such as salt, pepper and basil.
